          <h3> Last year I was blessed with the opportunity to be part of something incredible in my middle school's boys volleyball team. Being a fairly small school our school had not won a championship at any level in any sport since 1978. Since the sixth grade I had played for the middle school volleyball team, and had gotten better for two years. Everyone on the team knew that we were prepared to have a great season. The year before our team was injury plagued and finished with a 2-12 record which had deeply disappointed us. Although there were some close games, we utterly dominated our region, and finished with a 14-0 record with an undefeated season. My best friend Ryan and I lead the team for our plus to minus averages. I had a plus 37 per game, and he had a plus 41 per game. In addition our friend chase lead the state in assists per game averaging 17 assists per game with a plus 32 average per game. The day of the volleyball state finals was one of the most nerve wracking experiences of my life. We barely won our quarter final match, and our semifinal match was no less challenging, until we eventually made it to the final. In the final game my friend Ryan and I combined for a plus 82, and we ended up winning the game. Although this technically was not a project, I like to think of it as I project that my friends and I worked on for three years. Before the end of the year we were all honored at our graduation ceremony, and then all of the members of the team went their seperate ways including me. The picture on the left is of my friend Ryan and I at our graduation ceremony.</h3>

          <h3> The Disneyland After Dark Scratch Project was for me the most important project of the year, as although many of my classmates saw the scratch unit as a waste of time, I recognized the fact that a of the preset commands in Scratch represents real lines of code that I would later need in my CSE class. The challenges that my partner and I faced although not numerous were serious including figuring out how to use the coded presets to create levels for our game. Eventually we did overcome these problems by putting in the time and work to test multiple possibilities of how we could accomplish our vision for each level. In the end we had in my opinion one of the best projects in the class which unlike other games included a storyline that added depth to the already impressive project. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this project and feel like it provided a strong foundation for me to build on while learning other programming languages such as HTML, Python, SQL, and others.

             <h2>September 9th 2017-October 6th 2017 CSE</h2>

          <h3> Mole mash was a fairly exciting project that my partner Ibraheem Syed and I worked on in the months of October and November 2017. It was a fairly thrilling project as for the first time in the class, I felt as if I was given freedom by our teacher Mr.Kaemhs. During the first few days my partner and I struggled to find a platform that we could build off of to create our application. Our options were limited in choosing and we decided to choose a tutorial called mole mash. In addition to creating the application for a mobile platform we also were assigned to document our progress in the app's development. For two weeks we worked on adding some new interesting features to what once was a simple game. We ended up adding a crossbow that actually fired bullets and an accurate score system based on when the crossbow bolt came in contact with the mole. At the final gallery walk, a stage in which classmates share their applications with each other, our application received very positive feedback. Overall I was very happy with how the project turned out, and look forward to doing another like it. In this project I gained important organizational skills, while documenting our progress while creating the app, and good communication skills while having to communicate with my partner from home. </h3>

          <h3> The Python text Adventure Project in my opinion was was of the most challenging projects, but one of the most important and memorable of the year as it made me much more comfortable with coding in Python. Prior to being assigned this project I was very unsure of myself when it came to Python. My partner Zachary East was an awesome partner and helped me understand everything while we worked on the project. While he was in the driver's seat for most of the project in the end I had also made some valuable contributions. We only experienced a few challenges, the main one being that only one for loop was allowed to be used in the project, which made it significantly more difficult. Yet through all of the trials we encountered this project became an important event in which I have used to extend my Python skills. I remember this project as being a very proud accomplishemnt as sometimes when I am bored I even add to the game and am happy that I can change and edit the game per my liking so easily.
