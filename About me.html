          <h3>Hello My name is Jonathan Moradkhan, and I am a student at Dublin high school located in Dublin California. At school I take one of the most challenging arrays of classes that a freshman can take so one day I can become a web designer. My friends all hang out after school, and often invite me to come with them. Yet every single time I just give the same answer, I have work to do. Most of the time my friends just walk away and in a sarcastic voice, they tell me that I need to get out more, most people would be discouraged at this, but I feel a kind of pride. I go home and I work till 9:00 sharp, just to get up the next day and do the same. As a global society I think that we can improve on a lot of things. To do this we will need great new products that will advance our way of life, but what good will they be if people are not informed about them. Now I hope that my generation can make a difference in the constant struggle to better the human race, and I plan to do so by helping make websites for the companies that make these revolutionary products. My name is Jonathan Moradkhan, and I believe you die the last time time someone says your name. Now I don't know about you, but I plan on "living" for thousands of years. </h3>

        <h3> From the paragraph above you may assume that I really don't have a social life at school, but in fact I actually have a lot of friends, and love hanging out with them when appropriate, my favorite pastimes are basketball, volleyball, playing video games, buying shoes, and spending time with my family. To this day I continue to be a proud veteran fan of The Golden State Warriors since their "Dark Ages". I have played basketball on AAU teams and once won MVP of the AAU Walnut Creek League. I currently play volleyball for a club team and look forward to trying out for the varsity volleyball team this year. Being a volleyball and basketball player I have a great love for shoes, I currently own more than 8 pairs of shoes and plan on purchasing more in the near future. To purchase all of these shoes I have had to start a lawn care business, and work for my dad as a web designer. These two jobs have both given me a good amount of experience in the fields of finance, computer-science, and business. At school I participate in the waffle club, badminton club, and hope to participate in the heart for humanity club next year. </h3>
      <h3>In my free time at home I enjoy reading a good book while letting my dog sit on my lap. In my household I am, in general, very engaged in taking care of the house. I do all the yardwork, mow the lawn, and help with any other repairs to the house within reason. Whenever I have free time on the weekends I go to 24 Hour Fitness to workout and play basketball, or to the park with my best friend Jack. In conclusion I hope you learned a lot about me and who I am as a person. I also encourage you to check out the rest of my website and thank you for coming here. </h3>
